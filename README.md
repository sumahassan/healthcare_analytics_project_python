# 🏥 Case and Cost Analysis for Medicare Outpatients (Python & Tableau)

This project focuses on analyzing **Medicare outpatient data** to understand the relationship between **treatment costs** and the **number of reported cases** across various U.S. cities.  
The goal is to identify patterns, cost variations, and potential areas for cost optimization in outpatient services.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze how **medical costs** vary with the **volume of outpatient cases** and provide insights that can help identify:
- High-cost regions or facilities  
- Cities with unusually high or low case volumes  
- Trends or patterns linking cost and case count  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the **Medicare Outpatient Data** which includes information such as:
- Provider Name & City  
- Number of Outpatient Cases  
- Average Total Cost  
- Average Medicare Payment  
- Average Covered Charges  

**Data Source:** Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** → for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Tableau** → for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → for exploration and report generation  

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Cleaned and processed Medicare outpatient dataset using Python  
- Aggregated data at the **city level**  
- Compared **average cost vs number of reported cases**  
- Created interactive visuals in Tableau:
  - Scatter plots showing cost-to-case relationship  
  - City-wise comparison dashboards  
  - Trend charts showing average cost variation  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Some cities show **high outpatient costs despite low case counts**, suggesting potential inefficiency or specialized services.  
- Cities with **large case volumes** tend to have **lower average costs per case**, possibly due to economies of scale.  
- Cost variation across regions indicates opportunities for **standardization and resource optimization**.
